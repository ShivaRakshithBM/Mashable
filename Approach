Problem statement:
Identification of the news articles which will be popular among the readers for Mashable company

Questions:
1) What are the factors to include for determining the popularity of the news articles?
2) What is the metric to determine the popularity of the news articles?

Approach:
Followed the 6 stage framework of CRISP Data Mining process
CRISP - Cross-Industry Standard Process

Business understanding:

1) Mashable is a content (news articles) sharing platform which has its location in countries of USA, Australia, Canada
2 The users can share the articles in social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The more number of shares the article earns, the more is the impressions for the Mashable brand
3) Predictting the lnumber of shares (which indicates its popularity) helps them to provide the users with popular and personalized targeting of the users 

Data understanding

1) The dataset consists of 39,797 instances, each corresponding to a different article, and 61 attributes (58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive attributes, 1 target attribute)
2) The data includes both numeric as well as binary attributes, of which 58 predictive attributes can be classified to 8 aspects: words counts, content diversity, data channel, weekday at publish and sentiment

Data Preperation:

1) Normalization: I had to get all the variables into a standard range and give equal weightage to all of them in our predictions. I have implemented the min - max normalization

2) Log transformation
plotting the distribution of target variable -- number of shares, I noticed that it was right-skewed, so I did log transformation to reduce the skewnes

3) Principle Component Analysis
reduced the dimensions of the input dataset from 58 to 31, by  keeping 98% of the variance in the dataset

Modelling:
1) Have implemented SVM with non linear kernel, Decision trees, Random forests with Adaboost
2) The reason to select only non linear models is we hand pickex the imporatnt variables from the lot which might be affecting the target variable. Post which we checked the relationship between each of the hand picked variable and the target variable and found it was mostly non linear
3) Also, we saw that combination of variables together would afffect the target variable (interaction terms)

Evaluation:
1) I have used Cross validation of 10 folds. The model has been implemented to hold out data sets. 
2) Have used the metric Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to evaluate the difference of Actual and predicted number of shares
3) Baseline - We took the mean number of shares for the articles at the categoruy of the article and then leveraged RMSE for comparison

Deployment:
1) The analysis ccan be used by deploying thhe same in Mashable. Multiple users can access if its on a cloud sharing platform like AWS or R server
2) It can also be automated so that on a daily basis when the data changes, the predictions can be produced and used. We can connect the model to the platform from where the data is stored
